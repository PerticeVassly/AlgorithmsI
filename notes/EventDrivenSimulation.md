Simulate the motion of N moving particles that behave according to the laws of elasyic collision

Hard disc model

moving particles ineract collisions with each other and walls

Each particle is a disc known position, velocity mass and radius
No other forces

Between collisions, particles move in straight-line trajectories

Focus only one times when collisions occur

Maintain PQ of collision events, prioritized by time

Remove the min = get next collision
