Proposition: Any compare-based sorting algorithms must use at least lg(N!) ~ NlgN compares in the worst-case

pf:

Assume array consist of N dsictinct values a1 to an

worst case dicated by height h of decision tree

Binary tree of height h has at most 2^k leaves

N!different ordering -> least N! leaves

Merge sort is optimal respect to # compares

but it is not optimal to space usage
